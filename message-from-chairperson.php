                                The highest Education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our
                                life in harmony with all existence." - Rabindranath Tagore Every child is endowed with a
                                unique set of attributes and abilities, which needs to be nurtured so that they blossom.
                                Therefore, every child deserves an education that fosters academic excellence along with
                                all-round development, and ensures their physical, mental, social and emotional
                                well-being. We are inspired by these tenets in everything that we do at The Swift Model
                                School. Our excellent educational programs/activities are complemented by state-of-the
                                art facilities and world class resources, and our focus on systematic sports and
                                co-curricular opportunities facilitates children's holistic education by all means.
