                                The Swift Model School believes and promotes inclusive education system that removes
                                barriers limiting the participation and achievement for all learners, respects diverse
                                needs, abilities, and characteristics, and eliminates all forms of discrimination in the
                                learning environment.

                                At the heart of The Swift Model School is the acknowledgment of every child’s individual
                                needs and the experiences that allows them to bloom into a life which is ripe with all
                                the colors of physical, cognitive, social, emotional and spiritual growth. Since the
                                beauty of life lies in these multifarious hues, conscious investment in every child
                                makes it what it is - a mosaic, with every stroke rightly done to bring out the veiled
                                potential.

                                We ensure that our students are guided and encouraged to explore their own paths and
                                find what’s most effective for them. Every student of ours is provided with an
                                opportunity for exploration and exposure to such diverse experiences in order to set
                                themselves as independent thinkers who can shape the world for a better tomorrow.
