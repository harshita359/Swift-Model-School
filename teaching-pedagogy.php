                                The school activities help in boosting the confidence of students as they learn to
                                express themselves in front of others. These professionally designed and perfectly
                                executed activities help the students in their holistic development and assist in
                                developing critical and creative thinking as well as bringing social, emotional,
                                cognitive, analytical, leadership, technological, ethical, problem solving, recreational
                                and value based life skills and abilities to be successful and happy in 21st Century.
                                When theoretical curriculum and co-curricular activities are integrated together, then
                                chance of learning more and exploring more about one’s strengths, interests, and
                                abilities becomes higher. Therein lies the importance of these activities which are
                                complementary to the theoretical curriculum.

                            <p>In the 21st Century, the world is changing rapidly and so its needs. Therefore, the
                                conventional education curriculum, which was developed in the early 20th Century, has to
                                pave the way to a new kind of education and learning. In the book 21st Century Skills :
                                Learning for Life in Our Timesthe authors Bernie Trilling and Charles Fadel have
                                premised that “the world has changed so fundamentally in the last few decades that the
                                roles of learning and education in day-to-day living have also changed forever”.</p>
                            <p>This program is part of the school’s natural progression & evolution. At its heart, it is
                                a direct extension of one of our core pedagogical practices - experiential learning.
                                This will allow our students to experience the entire cycle of problem-solving &
                                creation. Having identified a challenge, they will collaborate to ideate, learn new
                                skills & use new tools, design and build prototypes, test for effectiveness and refine
                                their solutions.</p>

                            <p>The Swift Model School is a vibrant community of scholars and learners, who aim to grow
                                and learn from new experiences and prepare new generation kids to face the world with
                                all the might in accordance to GLOBAL COMPETENCE. Hence we foster a rigorous and highly
                                relevant, indigenously designed Coding and Robotics curriculum for the experiential
                                learning of programming for our students. The National Education Policy 2020 suggests
                                Coding and Robotics as a mandatory subject in middle classes. Taking a step forward we
                                are introducing a separate curriculum for Coding and Robotics from the very first class
                                as we believe that children as young as a first grader should start learning the basics
                                of programming as this is the elevation period of their creativity. </p>
                            <p>We proudly state that we are the only school of the city to introduce such a vivacious
                                and student friendly smart curriculum which is beyond the levels of any existing online

                                innovation, team collaboration, problem-solving, and critical thinking etc. Hence, the
                                sole purpose of organizing educational visits for our students is to give them the first
                                hand experience of what it is called Real Learning. </p>
                            <p>At Swift we regularly organize Grade-wise educational visits for our students so that it
                                can further enhance their classroom learning and they learn to interact within the peer
                                group while developing the problem-solving and team-collaboration skills at their end.
